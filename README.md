**Introduction**

Welcome to the Buildly CollabHub and Bug Reporting application! This robust, full-stack micro-application is meticulously crafted using the Django framework. It empowers you to manage a thriving collabhub and effectively track and address bugs reported by your users.

**Key Features:**

* **Streamlined CollabHub Management:** Facilitate seamless operations for your collabhub with features tailored for both vendors and customers. 
* **Efficient Bug Reporting:** Empower users to effortlessly submit bug reports, allowing you to prioritize and resolve issues swiftly. (Highlight specific functionalities, e.g., screenshots, detailed descriptions)

**Mono-Repo with Micro-Applications:**

This project leverages a mono-repository structure, ensuring efficient code organization and management. It's further enhanced by a microservices architecture, where individual components are decoupled and independently deployable, promoting agility and scalability.

**Getting Started**

This guide details the prerequisites and steps to set up and run the application in two environments:

1. **Docker Containers** (Recommended for production-like deployment)
2. **Local Virtual Environment** (Ideal for development and testing)


**Issue Reporting Tags**

Establish clear tags to categorize issues efficiently. Here's a suggestion (modify to suit your needs):

* `bug` - Genuine bugs that prevent intended functionality
* `enhancement` - Feature requests or proposals for improvement
* `documentation` - Issues related to unclear or missing documentation
* `question` - Inquiries about usage or functionality

**Contributing**

We highly encourage contributions from the community! Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for detailed guidelines.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/buildlyio/collabhub.git
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   cd collabhub
   docker-compose up -d  # Detached mode (background)
   docker-compose ps  # View running containers
   ```

**Local Virtual Environment Deployment**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.7 or later: Verify your Python version using `python3 --version`. If necessary, download the appropriate installer: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - pip: Ensure you have pip, the Python package installer, available.
   - virtualenv: Install virtualenv using pip: `pip install virtualenv`

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate  # Apply database migrations
   python manage.py runserver  # Start the development server
   ```

   You can now access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.

**Remember to replace placeholders** (e.g., specific features, license information, build tags, issue reporting tags) with your project details to create a comprehensive and informative README file.
