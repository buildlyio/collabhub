# Stripe Environment Variables for Production

# According to https://docs.stripe.com/keys, you only need these THREE variables:

# 1. SECRET KEY (Required for server-side API calls)
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY_HERE

# 2. PUBLISHABLE KEY (Optional, mainly for client-side Stripe.js)
# Since we're doing server-side checkout session creation, this is optional
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE

# 3. WEBHOOK SIGNING SECRET (Required for webhook verification)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET_HERE

# Other required variables for the marketplace:
FRONTEND_URL=https://collab.buildly.io

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Make sure your Stripe account is fully activated (not just created)
# - Verify the secret key works by testing it in Stripe's API explorer
# - For testing, use sk_test_... keys instead of sk_live_...
# - The API key (secret key) is the most important - it's what creates the checkout sessions
